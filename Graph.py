'''
This is an implementation of the adjacency-list representation of a graph
where the vertices are numbered from 0 through n-1.

The class has integer variables recording the number n of vertices
and number m of edges.  It has a list ._verts of length n of lists of integers.
The list that appears in position i of this list is the list of neighbors
of vertex i.  For example, if ._verts is [[1,2], [], [0]], then
there are three vertices, since there are three lists in it.  Vertex 0
has neighbors 1 and 2, vertex 1 has no neighbors, and vertex has 0 as
its only neighbor.
